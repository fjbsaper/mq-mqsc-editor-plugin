	<p>This is an overview of the MQSC Editor plugin for MQExplorer
		and Eclipse.
	<p>  This Eclipse plugin impelemnts all of the necessary pieces to create an Eclipse
		editor for the MQSC language. 
	<p> It provides parsing, syntax coloring, error identifcation, and text completion. 
		It also creates and manages an outline view - although this is currently buggy. 
		
	<p> The parser is built to be as complete a model of the MQSC language as possible,
		including zOS specific commands, objects, and parameters. 
		This model currently has to be built and maintained by hand. 
		I intend to update this model to build a complete PCF message - right now the Run action
		uses a PCF Escape message.
